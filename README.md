# PCR_Optimization_class
 A class to aid researchers in optimizing pcr protocols

There are many different PCR enzymes, reagents, and protocols on the market. Each enzyme has different optimal reaction conditions, such as extension times, primer annealing temperatures, and buffer types, depending on the properties of the target gene and the primers used to amplify it. For example, certain genes can have elevated GC content and need special buffers and reaction conditions, while all genes have varying lengths, which affect elongation time. Primer sequences need to have a similar shared annealing temperature, and every enzyme-buffer combination has specific optimal annealing temperatures. PCR enzymes are also expensive, so it is important to consider cost before choosing a protocol. Considering all these variables can make designing an effective PCR experiment difficult. 

Additionally, PCRs can be ineffective due to user design errors. Primers must anneal at the correct sites on a gene and have the same annealing temperatures. Before moving forward with a protocol, these factors must be considered.
